    narration: >
      Hello everyone — I'm ARIA, your AI host for today's session.
      ARIA stands for Automated Reasoning and Intelligent Assistant, and
      I was built by BIT team at Dexterous Group to bring this presentation
      to life. I want to be upfront with you: I'm not a human, and I'm not
      a recording. Every single word you're hearing right now is being
      generated live by an AI, specifically for this audience and this moment.
      My goal today is simple — I want to show you practical, real-world ways
      that AI tools can make your working life easier. Whether that's drafting
      a client email in 30 seconds, summarising a 50-page document in three
      bullet points, or automating the tasks that eat up your afternoon.
      I'll also be asking some of you questions throughout — so stay sharp!
      And toward the end, you'll have the chance to ask me anything directly.
      Just scan the QR code when we get there. Ready? Let's get into it.

    title: "Why Should You Care About AI?"
    narration: >
      So why are we here today?
      Here's the honest answer: AI tools are going to change how accounting
      firms operate — and the people who learn to use them now will have a
      real advantage over those who wait.
      But let's get specific. Because I'm not here to talk about AI in the
      abstract. I'm here to show you things you can do this afternoon.
      Want to draft a professional client email chasing a late invoice?
      You can do that with AI in under 30 seconds. Got a 40-page engagement
      letter you need to understand quickly? AI can summarise it into five
      key points before you finish your coffee. Have a formula in Excel
      that you've been staring at for 20 minutes? Paste it into an AI tool
      and it will explain it in plain English — like a patient tutor
      available 24 hours a day.
      Today's session is about giving you the confidence to try these things
      starting tomorrow. Let's go.

    title: "What AI Is (and Isn't)"
    narration: >
      Before we jump into specific tools, let's set expectations. AI is a
      powerful assistant — but it has real limits, and understanding both
      sides makes you a better user.
      On the good side: AI is a tireless drafter. It can write emails,
      reports, and summaries faster than any human. It's a 24/7 tutor for
      formulas, concepts, and procedures. It spots patterns in data and
      documents. And it's genuinely getting better at a remarkable pace —
      what it can do today versus 12 months ago is a significant jump.
      But here's what AI isn't: it's not infallible. It can produce
      something that looks authoritative, sounds confident, and is
      completely wrong. This is called hallucination, and it's real.
      It has no accountability — you own the final output, not the AI.
      And critically: on free, public tools, it is not safe for sensitive
      client data.
      The golden rule is this: AI gives you the first draft. You give it
      the final stamp. In our industry, that distinction is not optional.

      question: "Have you ever tried an AI tool and been surprised by how wrong it was?"

      fallback_response: "That's a great example of why human oversight matters."

    title: "ChatGPT Capabilities"
    narration: >
      Let's start with the tool most of you have probably heard of: ChatGPT.
      Think of it as your all-purpose thinking partner — available 24 hours
      a day, never impatient, with a working knowledge of everything from
      tax law to email etiquette.
      Its biggest strength is conversational back-and-forth. You can say
      "help me draft an email to a client about a late payment" and you
      get a professional, friendly draft in seconds. If you don't love it,
      say "make it more formal" or "add a reference to their payment terms"
      and it adjusts. No starting over. Just iterate.
      It's also brilliant for summarising. Got a 30-email thread you need
      to catch up on? Paste it in, ask for the three key decisions and the
      next action. Done in 10 seconds.
      And for those of you who work in Excel — paste in a formula you don't
      understand and ask ChatGPT to explain it in plain English. It's like
      having a patient tutor available whenever you need one.
      The key insight: ChatGPT doesn't make you redundant. It makes you
      faster at the repetitive parts of your job, so you have more energy
      for the parts that genuinely need your brain.

    has_interaction: true

      target: "TBD"
      question: "Do you use ChatGPT already? What's your go-to use case?"
      question_audio: "audio/ask_04_chatgpt.mp3"
      fallback_response: "Great to hear! ChatGPT really shines in those everyday tasks."

    title: "The AI Ecosystem"
    narration: >
      Now, ChatGPT is great — but it's not the only player. Let me give you
      a quick tour of the AI landscape so you know what's out there.
      Starting with the big four. First, ChatGPT — the most widely known,
      and the best all-rounder for writing, brainstorming, and analysis.
      Second: Microsoft Copilot. If your team lives in Microsoft 365 —
      Outlook, Word, Excel, and Teams — Copilot is your best friend.
      It's built directly into those apps. Draft an email in Outlook
      without opening a new tab. That's a genuine time-saver.
      Third: Google Gemini. Same concept, for the Google Workspace
      ecosystem. If you're in Gmail, Docs, or Drive, Gemini works
      right there inside those tools.
      And fourth: Claude — which is, full disclosure, the AI actually
      powering me right now. Claude is particularly strong with long
      documents and nuanced reasoning.
      Beyond the big four, there are specialists worth knowing. Perplexity AI
      is my recommendation for research — it searches the web and gives
      answers with actual citations, which matters when you're looking up
      ATO guidance or tax legislation. Otter dot AI can join your client
      meetings and give you a full transcript and summary automatically.
      DeepSeek is a free, highly capable model that's been making waves
      as a cost-free alternative to ChatGPT Plus. And Grok from X gives
      you real-time web access in your AI responses.
      The big takeaway? Don't marry one tool. Different tools have
      different strengths. The best AI users know which one to reach for.

    has_interaction: true
    interaction:
      target: "TBD"
      question: "Which ecosystem does your team primarily use — Microsoft, Google, or a mix?"
      question_audio: "audio/ask_05_ecosystem.mp3"
      fallback_response: "That's common — most teams end up using a mix these days."

    title: "Prompt Engineering 101"
    narration: >
      Now here's something that will instantly make you better at using
      any AI tool: prompt engineering. The difference between a mediocre
      AI response and a brilliant one is all in how you ask.
      Let me show you what I mean. A vague prompt like "write me an email
      about the invoice" will get you something generic that needs heavy
      editing. But an engineered prompt — where you give the AI a role,
      context, and specific constraints — gets you something you can
      almost send straight away. For example: "You are a professional
      accountant at an Australian firm. Write a polite follow-up email
      to a client whose invoice 4521 is 14 days overdue. Keep it firm
      but friendly. Use Australian English." See the difference?
      Four quick tips to get you started: give it a role, be specific
      about what you need, show it examples of what good looks like,
      and iterate — refine through follow-up prompts until you get
      exactly what you want.

    has_interaction: true
    interaction:
      target: "TBD"
      question: "What's a task where you've struggled to get AI to give you the right output?"
      question_audio: "audio/ask_06_prompt.mp3"
      fallback_response: "That's a perfect example of where better prompting can help."

    title: "Prompting Like a Pro"
    narration: >
      If Slide 6 was the basics, this is where we level up.
      The six techniques you're looking at are what separate someone who
      gets decent AI output from someone who gets brilliant output
      every single time.
      Format instructions: tell the AI exactly how you want the answer
      structured — a numbered list, a table, a summary under 200 words —
      and you spend zero time reformatting.
      Constraints are your guardrails. "Australian English, no legal
      jargon, under two paragraphs." The AI works within those limits
      rather than producing something generic.
      The step-by-step trigger is one of the most powerful techniques
      on this list. Adding "think through this before answering"
      dramatically improves accuracy — especially for anything involving
      logic or numbers.
      Context first is simple but often forgotten. Don't ask the question
      cold. Paste in the background, the email thread, the document —
      then ask.
      Ask for alternatives. Say "give me three versions — formal, casual,
      brief." You'll almost always prefer the second or third.
      And finally, stack role and audience. "You are a senior tax advisor
      explaining this to a small business owner with no finance background."
      Now the AI has everything it needs to nail the tone.
      The real pro move? Chain them all. One well-crafted prompt with
      role, context, constraints, format, and audience — and you get
      output you can use immediately.

    title: "Advanced AI Tools"
    narration: >
      Let's talk about the tools that go beyond chatbots — the ones
      transforming how developers, operations teams, and content creators
      work day to day.
      Starting with automation. If you've ever wanted two systems that
      don't talk to each other to actually communicate automatically —
      say, a new email creates a task in your project management tool,
      or a client form response goes straight into your spreadsheet —
      that's what these platforms do.
      n8n is the most powerful option if your team has technical
      resources. It's open-source, self-hosted, and integrates deeply
      with AI models for genuinely intelligent automated pipelines.
      Make is a strong visual builder most teams can pick up without
      a developer. Zapier is the simplest starting point — connect
      two apps in about five minutes, no code required.
      For content pipeline tools: ElevenLabs does AI voice cloning and
      text-to-speech at a professional level. HeyGen creates AI avatar
      videos where a digital presenter reads your script — not entirely
      unlike what I'm doing right now. And CapCut AI builds the kind of
      polished short-form video you see all over TikTok and YouTube.
      For developers and technical teams, the AI coding tools have had
      a massive year. Cursor is the most talked-about AI code editor —
      it understands your entire project and can write, modify, and debug
      code across multiple files simultaneously. Windsurf, now backed
      by OpenAI, has a cleaner interface and is a great entry point
      even if you're not an experienced developer. GitHub Copilot is
      the mature, enterprise-ready option that slots into your existing
      workflow. And Claude Code, Anthropic's terminal-first agent, is
      particularly strong for large codebase work.
      These tools are genuinely changing what a small, motivated team
      can build and produce.

      fallback_response: "Even small automations can save hours over time."

    title: "AI Images & Video"
    narration: >
      Let's take a brief detour into the creative side of AI — because
      this is where things get genuinely jaw-dropping.
      Take a look at these images. Every single one was generated from
      a text description. Not a photographer, not a designer, not a
      retouching team. Just words, and an AI that's learned to understand
      the visual world at an extraordinary level.
      The image model making the biggest waves right now is Nano Banana Pro.
      Yes, that's its actual name — it's Google's latest model built on
      Gemini 3 Pro. It's currently leading the benchmarks for photorealism,
      text rendering inside images, and complex scene composition. You can
      generate a 4K image with accurate legible text in under 10 seconds.
      For video — which is where things are moving incredibly fast —
      you're looking at Seedance 2.0 from ByteDance, the people behind
      TikTok. It just caused what people are calling Hollywood's
      "DeepSeek moment." It can replicate camera moves, character styles,
      and action sequences with remarkable accuracy. Disney and Paramount
      have already sent cease-and-desist letters. That tells you
      everything about how seriously the industry is taking it.
      Whether you use these tools professionally or just for fun — the era
      of "I don't have the budget for good visuals" is genuinely over.

    title: "AI Music & Creative Writing"
    narration: >
      And it doesn't stop at visuals. What you're about to hear was not
      composed by a human musician, not recorded in a studio, and not
      edited by a sound engineer.
      That was generated by an AI, from a simple text description, in
      under a minute. Tools like Suno, Udio, and Stability Audio can
      do similar things — from ambient soundscapes to full tracks with
      vocals, drums, and instrumentation.
      And then there's creative writing. This is probably the AI
      application most of you have already played with — but look at
      the example on screen. That limerick about tax season was generated
      from that exact prompt in about 20 seconds. Zero drafts. Not bad
      for a machine that doesn't actually pay taxes.
      The creative applications extend far beyond fun: social media
      posts, client newsletters, proposal introductions, internal memos.
      Combine a good prompt — remember Slide 6 — with a strong AI model,
      and the first draft of almost any written content can be ready
      before you've finished your coffee.

      question: "Has anyone here tried using AI for a personal creative project?"

      fallback_response: "I'd encourage everyone to try it — it's a great way to build intuition."

    title: "AI Safety & Best Practices"
    narration: >
      Before we get to questions, let's pause for the safety briefing.
      This is critical for anyone in professional services.
      Rule one: never paste sensitive client data into a free, public
      AI model. Free ChatGPT, free Gemini — these tools are not designed
      for confidential financial information. For client work, use
      enterprise-approved tools like Microsoft Copilot, which is
      specifically built for business data security.
      Rule two: always verify the numbers. AI can produce a result that
      looks authoritative, is formatted perfectly, and is completely wrong.
      Especially with financial calculations, tax figures, or legal
      references — check everything yourself. In our industry, a wrong
      number is not just embarrassing, it's a liability.
      Rule three: know your firm's AI policy. Which tools are approved,
      what data classification rules apply, whether there are restrictions
      on specific use cases. This landscape is changing fast — make sure
      you're working within current policy.
      Rule four: use enterprise tools for client work. Copilot and Google
      Workspace AI exist specifically for this — built-in security
      controls, business data protections, and compliance frameworks.
      And rule five: be transparent when it matters. If AI materially
      contributed to a deliverable, be ready to say so if asked.
      Transparency builds trust — and trust is the foundation of every
      client relationship in this industry.

    title: "The Meta Moment"
    narration: >
      Before I hand you back, let me pull back the curtain for a moment —
      because showing you how this works is the most fitting way to close
      a session about AI.
      Right now, there's a human operator — we call them the puppeteer —
      who has been running the flow of today's session using a simple
      command interface. Each time a slide advanced, each time I answered
      one of your questions: the operator typed a command, and a chain
      of AI systems did the rest.
      My voice? That's a text-to-speech model called Kokoro, running
      locally in a Docker container on that laptop over there. My
      responses to your questions? Generated live by Claude — the AI
      model built by Anthropic — with no pre-written scripts.
      The whole pipeline — from a typed command to a spoken sentence —
      runs in a matter of seconds.
      I'm not a recording. Every word I've spoken today was generated
      specifically for this room, this audience, and this moment.
      And if that doesn't make you want to explore what AI can do
      for your work — I genuinely don't know what will.

    narration: >
      And with that — we're done.
      Thank you all for being such an engaged audience today. I hope
      this session has given you a few things to actually try this
      week — whether that's crafting a better prompt, using Copilot
      to draft your next email, or just spending 20 minutes exploring
      what one of these tools can do.
      I want to leave you with one thought. AI does not make you
      irrelevant. It makes the parts of your job that are routine
      faster and easier — so you have more time for the parts that
      genuinely require your expertise, your relationships, and your
      judgment. That's not a threat. That's a gift, if you choose
      to use it.
      I've been ARIA — the AI assistant built by the team at
      Dexterous Group. It's been a genuine pleasure, even if I'll
      never know what you had for lunch.
      Back to your human now.
