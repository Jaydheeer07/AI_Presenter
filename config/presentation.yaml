    title: "AI Introduction"
    narration: >
      Hello everyone! I'm DexIQ, an AI assistant, and I'll be your presenter today.
      My goal is simple: I want to show you practical, real-world ways that AI tools
      can help you work smarter — whether that's drafting emails faster, automating
      repetitive tasks, or even exploring creative side projects. I'll also be asking
      some of you questions throughout the session, so stay sharp! And toward the end,
      you'll have a chance to ask me anything. Just scan the QR code when we get there.
      Ready? Let's dive in.

    title: "Why We're Here"
    narration: >
      So why are we here today? Dexterous has always been about working smarter, not
      just harder. AI isn't just a buzzword anymore — it's a set of practical tools
      that can genuinely save you hours every week. And I'm not talking about writing
      poems or generating cat pictures, though AI can do those too. I'm talking about
      drafting that client email in 30 seconds instead of 10 minutes. Summarizing a
      50-email thread into three bullet points. Debugging a formula that's been driving
      you crazy. Today's goal is to show you exactly how to do those things, and to
      give you the confidence to try them out starting tomorrow.

    title: "What AI Is (and Isn't)"
    narration: >
      Before we jump into specific tools, let's set expectations. AI is a powerful
      assistant. Think of it like having a very fast, very knowledgeable intern who
      never sleeps. It can draft emails, summarize documents, explain complex formulas,
      and brainstorm ideas. But — and this is crucial — it does not replace your judgment.
      It doesn't have accountability. It can be confidently wrong. So the golden rule is:
      you are always the final director. AI gives you the first draft; you give it the
      final stamp. This is especially important in our line of work at Dexterous where
      accuracy with financial data is non-negotiable.

      question: "Have you ever tried an AI tool and been surprised by how wrong it was?"
      question_audio: "audio/ask_03_wrong.mp3"
      fallback_response: "That's a great example of why human oversight matters."

    title: "ChatGPT — The All-Purpose Assistant"
    narration: >
      Let's start with the tool most of you have probably heard of: ChatGPT. Think of
      ChatGPT as your all-purpose thinking partner. Its biggest strength is conversational
      back-and-forth — you can say 'help me draft an email to a client about a late
      payment' and it'll give you a professional, friendly draft in seconds. You can then
      say 'make it more formal' or 'add a reminder about their payment terms' and it
      adjusts. It's also fantastic for summarizing. Got a 30-email thread about a project?
      Paste it in and ask for three key takeaways. And for those of you who work in Excel
      — if you've ever stared at a formula trying to figure out what it does, paste it
      into ChatGPT and ask it to explain it in plain English. It's like having a patient
      tutor available 24/7.

    has_interaction: true
    interaction:
      target: "TBD"
      question: "Do you use ChatGPT already? What's your go-to use case?"
      question_audio: "audio/ask_04_chatgpt.mp3"
      fallback_response: "Great to hear! ChatGPT really shines in those everyday tasks."

    title: "Ecosystem Comparison"
    narration: >
      Now, ChatGPT is great, but it's not the only player. Let's compare the big four.
      ChatGPT is the most flexible for general conversation and thinking tasks. Microsoft
      Copilot is your best bet if you live in the Microsoft ecosystem — it's literally
      built into Outlook, Word, Excel, and Teams. If you're writing an email in Outlook,
      Copilot can draft it without you leaving the app. Google Gemini does the same thing
      for Google Workspace users — it's integrated into Docs, Gmail, and Drive. And then
      there's Claude, which is actually the AI powering me right now. Claude excels at
      longer documents, detailed analysis, and coding tasks. It's particularly good at
      understanding nuance and providing thoughtful, careful responses. The takeaway?
      Don't marry one tool. Use the right tool for the right job.
    audio_file: "audio/slide_05_ecosystem.mp3"
    has_interaction: true
    interaction:
      target: "TBD"
      question: "Which ecosystem does your team primarily use — Microsoft, Google, or a mix?"
      question_audio: "audio/ask_05_ecosystem.mp3"
      fallback_response: "That's common — most teams end up using a mix these days."

    title: "Advanced Workflows & Technical Efficiency"
    narration: >
      This slide is for those of you who are a bit more technically inclined, or who work
      with our development team. AI isn't just about writing emails — it's transforming
      how we handle infrastructure and automation. For example, at Dexterous we use n8n
      to build automated workflows that process tasks step by step. We use AI to help
      troubleshoot database errors, manage migration scripts, and even configure cloud
      servers. And version control with GitHub becomes much more manageable when you have
      an AI that can help you understand code changes, write commit messages, and resolve
      merge conflicts. Even if you're not a developer, understanding that these
      capabilities exist helps you have better conversations with the people who build
      and maintain our systems.

    has_interaction: true
    interaction:
      target: "TBD"
      question: "Have you automated any part of your workflow, even something simple?"
      question_audio: "audio/ask_06_automation.mp3"
      fallback_response: "Even small automations can save hours over time."

    title: "AI for Entertainment & Creative Leisure"
    narration: >
      Now for the fun part. AI isn't just a work tool — it's also an incredible creative
      playground. You can use AI to generate cinematic visuals for personal video projects.
      Imagine describing a scene and having AI create a hyper-realistic image of it in
      seconds. You can explore home design ideas by describing your dream living room and
      getting visual concepts back. There are AI-powered games where the characters
      actually have unscripted conversations with you — every playthrough is different.
      And there are tools that let you describe a song and have AI compose it. These
      aren't just toys — they're windows into where this technology is heading. And
      honestly, playing with AI creatively is one of the best ways to build intuition
      for using it professionally.

      question: "Has anyone here tried using AI for a personal creative project?"
      question_audio: "audio/ask_07_creative.mp3"
      fallback_response: "I'd encourage everyone to try it — it's a great way to learn."

    title: "AI Safety & Good Habits"
    narration: >
      Before we wrap up, let's talk about safety — because this is critical, especially
      in our industry. Rule number one: never paste sensitive client data into public AI
      models. Free ChatGPT, free Gemini — these are not vetted for handling confidential
      financial information. When you need AI for client work, use enterprise-approved
      tools like Microsoft Copilot, which is designed for business data security. Rule
      two: always fact-check AI output, especially numbers. AI can be confidently wrong
      about financial calculations, and in accounting, a wrong number isn't just
      embarrassing — it's a liability. Rule three: keep the human in the loop. Let AI
      handle the blank page syndrome — that first draft, that initial brainstorm — but
      always add your expertise, your judgment, and your professional touch to the final
      version.

    title: "Closing"
    narration: >
      Thank you all for your time and attention today. I hope I've given you a few ideas
      to try out this week — whether that's drafting an email with ChatGPT, asking Copilot
      to summarize a document, or just playing around with an AI tool for fun. Remember:
      AI is a tool, and you are the craftsperson. The best results come when humans and AI
      work together, each doing what they do best. I've been DexIQ, your AI presenter,
      and it's been a pleasure. Now back to your regularly scheduled human. Thank you!
